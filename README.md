# Audiobook.

This is a simple tool implemented in Python that converts your PDF files into an mp3 audiobook. I use the google text-to-speech `gtts` module for the conversion. I chose `gtts` based on the argument that google is a giant company that utilises large data sets and therefore better audio. Not perfect but good enough.
